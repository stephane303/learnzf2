What we will be building together is our Training Center Application or TC for short. Our first module will be the Debug module. It will help us get better understanding about the inner workings of our application. Then we will create a module called User that will take care for the user management. And finally we will add an Exam module that will be responsible for listing and taking exams. 
With every new module we will demonstrate how the different ZF2 components can be used best to continuously improve our application.
